## Ninja Challenge

An attacker threw a shuriken (ninja throwing star) at some people in the village.

Police were unable to recover the weapon, but they happened to have a 24 GHz CW radar pointing in the direction of the attacker, and they managed to capture some mixed-down IF data from a single channel, with a sample rate of 10 kHz. 

From the spectrogram, it looks like we may be able to gain some information about the shuriken that was thrown!
Police have confiscated the shuriken of all the known ninjas in the village area, and given us a schematic (ShurikenSchematic.png) with their shape and size. 

Can you use this along with the radar data to identify which suspect attacked the village?
Or even better, provide some source code that we can use to identify any shuriken from radar data, in case they attack the village again?
