**Suspect #2**

The source code lives in MicroDopplerSignatureOfShuriken.m (matlab 2021a). Contact me for Radar Data in order to run it. 

### Why Suspect 2?
* The micro-doppler spectrogram image labelled SpectrogramOfMysteryShuriken tells us that there are 3 blades. 
* And also that the blades are asymmetrical. 
* The calculations done in the excel spreadsheet labeled 'BladeLengthCalculation.xlsx' tell us that the blade length is approximately 50mm.
